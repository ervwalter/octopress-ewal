		Hey, there! As you may be aware, TrendWeight is a web application that I originally created for myself, but then decided to make available for anyone to use.  In reality, though, I am just a computer geek who likes to develop web applications in his free time&mdash;I'm not some big corporation with a team of support staff.  That said, I am always willing to try to help or answer questions if you have them.  Just email me at <a href="mailto:support@trendweight.com">support@trendweight.com</a> and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.
