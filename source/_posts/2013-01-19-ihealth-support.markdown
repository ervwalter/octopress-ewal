I just noticed that there is another WiFi scale on the market from [iHealth](http://ihealthlabs.com/). In fact, it may have been on the market for a while.  Actually, they have two scales: a low cost bluetooth only, weight-only scale and a $110 wifi + bluetooth scale that does weight and various other measurements like body fat.

Does anyone have one of these scales?  Do you like it?

They appear to have an open API similar to FitBit and Withings and so I could add support to TrendWeight for these devices.  I can do the programming with just their API documentation, but I don't have one of their scales to test with.

If you have one of these scales and would like to help me try it with TrendWeight, let me know by emailing me at <support@trendweight.com>.
