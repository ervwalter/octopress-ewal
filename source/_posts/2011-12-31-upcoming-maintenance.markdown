Just a heads up that I plan to move TrendWeight to some new servers at some point over the next few days.  I don't anticipate any problems and the site should remain available throughout the change.  I have tested the new servers pretty well, but there is always a chance that something will go wrong.

If you do see any problems over the next few days, please bear with me and I will resolve them as quickly as possible.

**Update, 7:30pm on Jan 1, 2012:**

The change is complete and everything appears to be working.  I'll be watching a little more closely than I normally do for the next day or two, but if you see anything not working, please just drop me an email at support@trendweight.com.
