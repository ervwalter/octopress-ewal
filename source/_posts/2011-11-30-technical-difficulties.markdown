Sometime last night, the Withings website stopped responding to requests that TrendWeight makes to get new weight readings for users.  This means your charts and statistics are not being updated with today's weigh-in.

I am not sure what the cause of the problem is, but I have emailed Withings to make sure they are aware of the issue. Because Withings is located in France and it is almost the end of the business day there, I am not sure if they will get this resolved today or not.

In any case, I am continuing to monitor the situation and will be looking for ways to fix it myself while waiting for Withings to respond.

Sorry for any inconvenience.

**Update:** Of course 15 minutes after I posted this, the issue seems to be resolved, at least for now.  Charts are getting updated again.  I'll keep an eye on it throughout the day to make sure it keeps working.
